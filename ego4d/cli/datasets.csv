dataset,description
annotations,The full set of annotations for the majority of benchmarks.
full_scale,The full scale version of all videos.  (Provide `benchmarks` or `video_uids` filters to reduce the 5TB download size.)
clips,Clips available for benchmark training tasks.  (Provide `benchmarks` or `video_uids` filters to reduce the download size.) 
video_540ss,The downscaled version of all videos - rescaled to 540px on the short side.  (Provide `benchmarks` or `video_uids` filters to reduce the 5TB download size.) 
annotations_540ss,The annotations corresponding to the downscaled `video_540ss` videos - primarily differing only in spatial annotations (e.g. bounding boxes).
